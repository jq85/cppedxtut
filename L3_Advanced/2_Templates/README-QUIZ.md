# Question 1
At which stage in a program's lifecycle are Template Classes declared? (Choose one)
 - [?] Before compilation
 - [?] During compile time
 - [NOK] During runtime incorrect
 - [?] After the program has been executed

# Question 2
True or False: A random-access iterator is a vital component of the implementation of any template class. (Choose one)
  True

# Question 3
1/1 point (graded)
True or False: A class can be declared by using either the Typename or Class keywords. (Choose one)
  True

# Question 4
1/1 point (graded)
The STL contains Sequence Containers and Associative Containers. Which containers store their elements in a sorted state unless you intentionally use the unordered version? (Choose one)
  - [NOK] Sequential Containers
  - [OK] Associative Containers correct

# Question 5
How does the C++ Standard stipulate floats and doubles should be passed in when defining nontype template parameters? (Choose one)
  - [OK] via reference
  - [NOK] via value

# Question 6
What is the purpose of the Adapter Design Pattern? (Choose one)
  - [NOK] It helps the developer by designing their templates such that they can be adapted for several different uses
  - [NOK] It enables a function to adapt to parameters of unspecified type for the purpose of generalization
  - [OK] It allows for the reuse of existing code that does not provide a specific interface correct

# Question 7
When specifying default template parameters, as long as the first argument has a default value, the other arguments do not need one. (Choose one)
  False

# Question 8
How does implementing Template Specialization lead to an improvement in performance? (Choose one)
  - [NOK] Creating a template with a limit on accepted types means that it will be called less frequently
  - [OK] Giving the compiler an idea of what types will be processed allows for precomputation during compilation correct
  - [NOK] Specialized templates perform much better with arguments of all types since the template function is specialized for speed

# Question 9
Which of the following are examples of Sequence Containers? (Select all that apply)
  - [NOK] Set
  - [OK] Deque
  - [OK] Array
  - [OK] List
  - [NOK] Map

# Question 10
A non-type template parameter will accept any argument as long as the value and sign match the template type. (Choose one)
  True
