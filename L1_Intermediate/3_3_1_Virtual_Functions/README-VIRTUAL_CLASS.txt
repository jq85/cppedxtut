What is one reason for creating abstract classes?
To prevent the class from being instantiated in code

No objects of an abstract class can be created.

Abstract types cannot be used as:
  - parameter types,
  - function return types,
  - type of an explicit conversion.


Pointers and references to an abstract class can be declared.
