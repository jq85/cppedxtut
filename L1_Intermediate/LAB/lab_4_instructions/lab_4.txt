# Lab Instructions
==================

For this Lab, you're going to leverage what you learned about files, file streams, and string streams to create a digital donation record.

First, use your favorite text editor or your IDE to create a text file called "donation_total.txt".
This will be your record of the total amount of donations your program has received.
Since this is the first step, you don't have any donations yet. Add a 0 to your text file then save & close it.

The first thing your program will do when it runs is check the current running total.
It will do this by opening donation_total.txt and checking the value of the most recent total.
This will ensure that you have an accurate total, even if you run your program multiple times.

Your program will accept user-entered "donations" in the format "<name> <donation_amount>" from the console.
For example: "Tom 25", which refers to a $25 donation from Tom.
It will then extract the donation amount, convert it to an integer amount, then add that donation to a running total.
Every time that the running total is updated, append the new total to your donation_total.txt.

Implementation Tips:
  - Remember that the cin >> operator only accepts one word at a time. Multi-word entries require std::getline().

  - stringstream objects are a good method for splitting up multiword strings.

  - stoi is a function that converts a numerical string into an integer.

  - If you have multiple donation totals recorded in your file, the most recent one will be at the end of the file.
    One good way of extracting this entry would be to use a loop that continually reads in lines from your file,
    then temporarily stores each entry until it reaches the End Of File pointer.
